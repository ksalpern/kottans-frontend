I already worked with HTML&CSS, you can check my recent repos and also my [codepen](https://codepen.io/ksalpern/). 

I liked lectures from Coursera, the material is quite important for those who only starts but of course, the best way to learn programming is to practice.


## Something interesting

Here is a [link](https://livecodestream.dev/post/8-cool-css-tips-tricks-to-impress/) that impressed me. I adore working with CSS, you can always get to know something new

The most I liked that we can use different cursor values in CSS, just [take a look](https://livecodestream.dev/post/8-cool-css-tips-tricks-to-impress/#cursors)

What did you like the most in the article?

## What do I plan to use in future

1. I'm currently doing responsive layout with mobile first method, you can check my progress [here](https://github.com/ksalpern/NFT-me). So it were important to get to know more about media queries.

2. Recently I got to know that
 > meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0"
    this gives the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling.

3. If image doesn't display for whatever reason, the same space that the image would have taken up would still be taken up. Without that, there is a potential of breaking the layout that depends on the image being there.

4. More about [box-sizing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bExVtvdaMG4)
