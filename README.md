# kottans-frontend
Hey my friends! Here are some rules I'm gonna follow while doing stage 0 with [Front-End Course. kottans](https://github.com/kottans/frontend/blob/2022_UA/contents.md) and shortly about completed tasks. Also you can see more informed feedbacks from me following the links down here, they can remind you some essential things about programming.
Thanks for your time!)

### For each activity I'll answer the following questions in my repository:

1. name (at least one) thing that was new to me
2. name (at least one) thing that surprised me
3. name (at least one) thing that I'm going to use in the future
